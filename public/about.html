<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Zach and I'm currenty studying in IT however lately I've been picking up web development as kind of a side hobby as I found front end
  development kinda of interesting. I also find that my current knowledge of IT and learning backend infrastructure plus learning fullstack web development so learning 
  how to not only make websites but also learning how to communicate with the backend as well will be very useful to know if I ever find myself transitioning from IT
  to Web development. I also really like food. Sushi and pizza specifically lol.</p>
